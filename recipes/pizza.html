    <h3>How to make this amazing dish</h3>

    <p>Don't even think of running to the pantry or store
        and grabbing "whatever" for the noodle base of this
        recipe. Einkorn Flour is a must for this dish.
    </p>

    <p>Unsure about <strong>Einkorn</strong>? Well for starters
    it contains HALF the chromosomes as traditional Durham Wheat!
    </p>

    <p>Let's look at the other <em>Ingredients needed</em>:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Einkorn</li>
        <li>Tomatoes (diced)</li>
        <li>Fresh ground Pepper</li>
        <li>Pink Himalayan Salt</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>Lightly flour your counter-top</li>
        <li>Put all wet ingredients into a large mixing bowl</li>
        <li>Pre-heat oven to 375 degrees</li>
        <li>Place dough knife in freezer! This will help keep
            the dough from warming and sticking to the knife</li>
    </ol>
